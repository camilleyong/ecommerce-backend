## User Story
I am using Insomnia and MySQL Workbench to test the category, tag, and products in the backend. I use the get, get the ID, put, post, and delete request.
It was fun doing this homework and I had ran into small errors and my classmate helped me fixed my minor mistakes. It can be confusing with all of packages installing and remembering to use SQL.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
